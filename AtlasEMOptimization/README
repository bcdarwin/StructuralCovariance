A bunch of python code to optimize a set of labels to best match structural covariance blobs.

Optimization is done using an EM algorithm variant:

EXPECTATION STEP
-compute structural covariance maps with mean values under each label as seed
-this will give a blob map with one blob of high correlations around the label
-this blob corresponds to the new label

MAXIMIZATION STEP
-take each aforementioned blob, corresponding to each label, and set it as the new label

This is a work in progress.
